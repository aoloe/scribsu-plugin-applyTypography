# applyTypography Plugin for Scribus

Based on _actionSearch_ and _applyStyle_, create a plugin for applying some of the advanced typographic settings:

- tracking
- word spacing
- letter width

While the dialog is open, pressing different keys (<, >, +, -, ...) should increase or dicrease the values for each formatting.
